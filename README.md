# ControlHorario - Employee Time Tracking Bot

**ControlHorario** is a Python-based employee time tracking system built using a Telegram bot interface. This bot allows users to register their work hours by logging entry and exit times, making it ideal for managing and tracking employee attendance in small to medium-sized teams. All recorded data is stored in Excel files for easy access and analysis.

## Key Features:
- **User Registration**: New users can register their full name via the bot to identify their entries.
- **Entry and Exit Tracking**: Users can register their entry and exit times using simple commands (`/entrada` and `/salida`).
- **Data Storage**: All registered entries and exits are stored in an Excel file (`control_horarios.xlsx`), making it easy to maintain a history of attendance.
- **Hours Worked Calculation**: The bot automatically calculates the hours worked based on entry and exit times.
- **User Report**: Users can generate a summary report of their total hours worked with the `/reporte` command.

## How It Works:
1. **User Registration**: The user starts by registering their full name with the `/registrar` command.
2. **Register Entry**: To log their entry time, the user sends the `/entrada` command, and the bot records the current time as the entry.
3. **Register Exit**: The user can then send the `/salida` command to log their exit time. The bot calculates the total hours worked and updates the Excel file.
4. **Generate Report**: The `/reporte` command shows a summary of the user's total hours worked.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Telegram Bot API**: Used to interact with users via Telegram.
- **openpyxl**: Handles data storage and manipulation in Excel files.
